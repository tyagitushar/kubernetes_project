Hi this is Kubernetes project which was developed by me.

# we are going to deploy wordpress app which will used mysql as database to store data. we will create a persistent app through persistent volumes.
# This app uses inbuild DNS feature for service discovery.
# wordpress.yaml and my_sql_DB.yaml have the respective deployments.
# services.yaml has service for wordpress and mysql pods.
# persistent_volume.yaml will create volumes in cluster.
# persistent_volume_claim.yaml has the claims for volumes in cluster.
